The files here help run Recur video plugins in kiosk/gallery mode.
Do this from the repository root:

    make startup/rnnca.desktop
    # or
    make startup/recur.desktop

and copy the desktop file to ~/.config/autostart on a Linux desktop.
The next time you log in, the thing will start up automatically. but
be warned that it will start up in full screen and *REALLY* ANNOYING
if you do it on your work machine. It is for exhibition machines only.
